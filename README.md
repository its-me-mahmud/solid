## SOLID PRINCIPLES

#### 1. Single Responsibility

Each class should have only one sole purpose and not be filled with excessive functionality.

#### 2. Open Closed

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

#### 3. Liskov Substitution

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

#### 4. Interface Segregation

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

#### 5. Dependency Inversion

Components should depend on abstractions not on concretions.
